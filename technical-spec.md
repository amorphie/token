# OAuth 2.0 Server Technical Specification

## 1. Introduction
   - The OAuth 2.0 server aims to provide secure authorization and authentication services for client applications.
   - The server will adhere to the OAuth 2.0 protocol, allowing clients to obtain access tokens to access protected resources.
   - The scope includes the implementation of authorization endpoints, token endpoints, and token validation mechanisms.

## 2. Architectural Overview
   - The OAuth 2.0 server will be developed using a microservices architecture, enabling scalability, modularity, and independent deployment of services.
   - The key microservices involved are:
     - Workflow Service: Handles the authentication flows and manages the authorization process.
     - Fact Service: Manages user and client information for authentication and authorization purposes.
     - Consent Service: Handles consent management for user consent to access their resources.
     - Tag Service: Manages user or scope tags for more granular access control.

## 3. System Requirements
   - Functional requirements:
     - Clients should be able to register and obtain client credentials (client ID and secret).
     - Users should be able to authenticate and authorize client applications to access their protected resources.
     - The server should issue and validate access tokens and refresh tokens.
   - Non-functional requirements:
     - The server should be able to handle a high volume of requests securely.
     - The server should support multiple client applications and users concurrently.

## 4. User Interface
   - The OAuth 2.0 server typically does not have a user interface, as it primarily deals with authentication and authorization flows.
   - Any necessary administrative UI can be developed using web technologies and integrated with the server.

## 5. Data Model
   - The data model will include entities such as User, Client, Consent, and Scope.
   - The Fact Service will handle user and client data management.
   - The Consent Service will manage consent information.
   - The Tag Service will handle user or scope tags.

## 6. System Components (Microservices)
   - Workflow Service: Handles the authentication flows and manages the authorization process.
   - Fact Service: Manages user and client information for authentication and authorization purposes.
   - Consent Service: Handles consent management for user consent to access their resources.
   - Tag Service: Manages user or scope tags for more granular access control.

## 7. APIs and Services
   - Each microservice exposes its own API endpoints for performing specific functionalities.
   - The APIs utilize RESTful architecture for communication between microservices.
   - API documentation (e.g., Swagger) should be provided for each microservice.

## 8. Algorithms and Business Logic
   - Token generation: Utilize a secure random token generator to generate authorization codes, access tokens, and refresh tokens.
   - Token expiration: Set appropriate expiration times for tokens based on the server's security requirements.
   - Token validation: Implement algorithms to verify the authenticity and integrity of access tokens.
   - JWK support: Implement support for JSON Web Keys (JWK) to enable the usage of asymmetric cryptography for token validation.
   - Password storage: Store passwords securely using the Argon2 encryption algorithm with salted hashes.

## 9. Performance and Scalability
   - Implement caching mechanisms to store client and token information to improve performance.
   - Employ horizontal scaling techniques to handle increased traffic and distribute the load across multiple instances of microservices.
   - Utilize containerization technologies like Docker for easy deployment and scalability in the OpenShift environment.

## 10. Security and Privacy
    - Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for all interactions with clients and users.
    - Protect sensitive information such as passwords and tokens using industry-standard encryption techniques.
    - Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent brute force and DoS attacks.

## 11. Testing and Quality Assurance
    - Perform unit testing for each microservice component, covering various authentication and authorization scenarios.
    - Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between microservices via RESTful APIs.
    - Utilize testing frameworks like NUnit or xUnit to create and run test cases.

## 12. Deployment and Infrastructure
    - Deploy the microservices of the OAuth 2.0 server as individual containers on OpenShift, a containerization platform.
    - Utilize container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage the deployment and scaling of microservices.
    - Set up proper monitoring and alerting mechanisms within the OpenShift environment.

## 13. Error Handling and Logging
    - Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages to clients and users.
    - Utilize logging frameworks like Serilog or NLog to log system events, errors, and user activities for debugging and auditing purposes.

## 14. Real-time Communication
    - Incorporate SignalR library to provide real-time communication capabilities within the OAuth 2.0 server flow.
    - Utilize SignalR for features such as real-time notifications, event broadcasting, and bi-directional communication.

## 15. Maintenance and Support
    - Use TFS (Team Foundation Server) for issue tracking, bug tracking, and task management.
    - Use version control (e.g., Git with TFS) to track code changes and facilitate collaboration.
    - Document the OAuth 2.0 server's configuration, endpoints, and security considerations for future reference.
